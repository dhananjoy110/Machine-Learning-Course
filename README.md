# Digit Recognition using TensorFlow (Google Colab)

This is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates how to recognize handwritten digits using a simple neural network built with TensorFlow. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of digits (0–9).



## What It Does

- Loads the **MNIST** dataset from TensorFlow
- Normalizes the image data (pixel values from 0–255 to 0–1)
- Builds a neural network using:
  - Input Layer (Flatten)
  - One Hidden Layer (Dense, ReLU)
  - Output Layer (Dense, Softmax)
- Trains the model over 5 epochs
- Evaluates model performance on the test set
- Displays one test image and the model’s prediction



##  Technologies Used

- Python
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
- Matplotlib (for plotting the test digit)
